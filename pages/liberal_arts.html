          <h4> Case 1: <br>
          --- Japanese Printed Work: Hiroshige </h4>
          <h4> >> Background</h4>
          <p>While Japan remained largely isolated from the rest of the world until the Meiji restoration of 1868, the presence of small Dutch trading outposts from 1609 onward allowed a certain interchange between Japan and the West. Both Hokusai and Hiroshige were influenced by the use of perspective in Dutch prints, and one of the pigments used in printing their woodblocks was "Berlin blue" (now more often called "Prussian blue"), which became more widely available in the late 18th century. Ukiyo-e prints were sold either individually or in books, and commonly depicted "the floating world" - the everyday life of merchants and workers in Edo (the city that later became Tokyo) and other parts of Japan. Printing allowed a much broader dissemination of art than painting, which of course took a great deal of time by comparison. (Note that the vertical fold lines in some of the Hokusai images are the result of photographing prints from books).</p>

          <h4> >> Author</h4>
          <p>Utagawa Hiroshige (1797–1858), also known as Ando Hiroshige, was a prominent Japanese ukiyo-e artist, one of the last great figures of this traditional woodblock printing genre. Hiroshige is best known for his landscapes, particularly series that depict famous scenes across Japan, with a significant emphasis on the interplay of light, weather, and season.</p>
          <p>Born in Edo (modern-day Tokyo), Hiroshige started his career as a disciple in the Utagawa school, initially producing works featuring traditional subjects like portraits of kabuki actors and beautiful women (bijin-ga). However, his fame grew significantly with the release of "The Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido" (1833-1834), a series that captured the journey along the Tokaido road, the main route between Edo and Kyoto. This series showcased his unique ability to depict everyday life and natural landscapes with a remarkable sense of depth, perspective, and atmospheric effects, setting a new standard for landscape ukiyo-e.</p>

          <h3>Cases</h3>
          <h4>Case 1: Artwork Analysis <br>
            --- Kilns and the Hashiba Ferry on the Sumida River by Hiroshige</h4>
           <p>In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, it is easy to overlook the profound significance hidden within the seemingly ordinary scenes that surround us. People feel about every day as another day, rushing about their business without taking a second to unravel the meaning of their life. Utagawa Hiroshige, a great master of Japanese Ukiyo-e prints, lends the details of everyday life a sense of significance. Through his depiction of everyday life in “Kilns and the Hashiba Ferry on the Sumida River,” he encourages the audience to appreciate the balance between humans and nature, as well as the symbiotic relationship between economic development and harmonious living. Specifically, he achieves this by employing a low point of view, utilizing a rich palette of colors, lines, and tones, and crafting a thoughtful composition that accentuates the kilns and ferry, symbolic of economic vitality.</p>
           <p>Hiroshige’s use of a low vantage perspective in this masterpiece offers viewers a unique lens through which to perceive everyday life. In “Kilns and the Hashiba Ferry on the Sumida River,” the audience is positioned above kilns and the river, yet beneath the billowing smoke, looking far off into the distance, which directs them to put emphasis on the landscape in the foreground. As the audience carefully observes the scene depicted in the artwork, the smoke spreading out from kilns is what first jumps into their views, and then is the Hashiba ferry on the Sumida River, including people, boats, and ducks, and finally is the landscape, a few distant mountains, and the sunset. This deliberate sequencing guides them through the layers of the composition, ultimately highlighting the kiln and ferry as crucial elements in the portrayal of daily activities. Therefore, Hiroshige’s deliberate use of perspective prompts the audience to perceive the nuanced significance embedded in the seemingly ordinary daily scenes. </p>
           <p>Delving deeper into the intricacies of Hiroshige’s work, the details he incorporates, such as the vibrant colors, lines, and tones, contribute to the portrayal of a harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. The vivid colors of the distant landscapes and sunset – the vibrant green lands and the blend of orange and red sunset – convey the lively and joyful ambiance of the river, while the smoke from the kilns disrupts this harmony. The transition from black to white in the smoke delineates the boundary between human activity and the untouched natural environment. Black smoke passes through kilns, the river, and landscapes, revealing the area where people do their daily chores and other activities causes negative impacts on the environment to some degree. Smoke in the upper half of the work, in contrast, shows the natural, pure state of the air where no other pollutants are generated. Besides, the line and shape of the smoke break the work into two uneven segments. The left side is the natural scenario, which occupies a much less area than the right that shows the coexistence of man and nature. Generally, the color in this work is mostly soft and warm (except the kiln), creating a sense of serenity and peace, symbolizing the harmonious relationship between humanity and nature. Hiroshige subtly calls upon the audience to cherish and preserve nature, recognizing it as the most valuable asset through the emphasis on the kiln and its implications. </p>
           <p>The composition of Hiroshige’s artwork, featuring the kilns and ferry prominently, reveals the economic and social aspects of people’s life in Edo. Kilns and the ferry are placed in dominant positions to highlight crucial daily activities. The smoke from kilns signifies industrial or manufacturing activities, highlighting the economic endeavors of pottery production or ceramic firing. The presence of boats reflects the bustling scenario of the river as a hub of trade and transportation. People in boats may load goods onto the ferry, indicating the river, which might be an important transportation route, carries on people’s daily economic activities and prompts economic development. The juxtaposition of ducks with boats adds a touch of warmth and harmony, symbolizing the coexistence of humans and nature. Hiroshige's deliberate composition effectively communicates the integration of economic and social aspects within the daily lives of people, emphasizing the friendly relationship between humans and nature. </p>
           <p>Hiroshige meticulously captures the details of everyday life in Edo in “Kilns and the Hashiba Ferry on the Sumida River,” transforming the mundane scenario into a significant one. Through his unique perspective, varied use of colors, lines, and tones, and a carefully crafted composition, he elevates the portrayal of daily life along the Sumida River. Each brushstroke and composition choice contributes to a deeper understanding of the symbiotic relationship between humans and nature. Particularly, the emphasis on the kilns, the fleeting nature of the smoke against the serene landscape, underscores the coexistence and necessity of humans and nature for peaceful living. In general, Hiroshige’s artwork showcases his ability to instill values through depictions of everyday life, providing the audience with a nuanced appreciation for seemingly ordinary daily scenes and inviting them to contemplate the profound significance inherent in the details of their own lives. </p>
