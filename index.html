          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Hi! I'm Polaris Wu. Currently a <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html">computer science major</a> student:) and am planning to take mathematics as a minor. I'm also explored various liberal arts topics and take many relevant class at NYU. This semester I delve deep into analyzing the relationship between the modern technology and we human beings. Last semester I immersed myself into the artistic atmosphere, appreciating Japanese masterpiece and catching a glimpse of their life style and life attitude. Generally, I love getting exposed to new things and perspectives, and learning new knowledge!</p>

          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I'll introduce my academic interests around three sections: <a href="./pages/major_computerScience.html">Computer Science</a>, <a href="./pages/minor_math.html">Mathematics</a>, <a href="./pages/liberal_arts.html">Liberal Arts</a>. <br>Note: Since I'm still in the process of learning and exploring computer science, and there's not too much stuff about mathematics, I'll elaborate on these two sections later:) Now I posted my personal insights about one of my favorite artwork as an example of my Liberal Arts' outcome!</p>
